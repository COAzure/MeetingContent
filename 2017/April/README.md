# Integrate All the Things: PowerApps and Microsoft Flow for Developers

**Abstract**
 PowerApps and Microsoft Flow are enterprise services that allows power users and developers to build applications that connect with numerous consumer and enterprise sources using PowerPoint and Excel-like tools.  In this session we will dive in to the integration points for PowerApps and Microsoft Flow with various sources such as Azure SQL, OneDrive, Twitter, API apps, and more.  We will also talk about the developer story for integrating with custom APIs and on-prem data sources such as SQL Server and SharePoint.  Lastly we will have an interactive demo combining multiple services to show how easily you can create and consume apps across Windows, iOS, Android, and web.  All source code is available on GitHub.
